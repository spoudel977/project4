Project Proposal: Credit Risk Machine Learning Analysis

Project Title:

Credit Risk Machine Learning Analysis

Project Overview:

The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the credit risk associated with loan applicants. By analyzing historical loan data, the model will identify patterns and key indicators of credit risk, enabling financial institutions to make informed lending decisions, reduce default rates, and optimize their credit portfolios.

Objectives:

To collect and preprocess historical loan data.
To explore and visualize the data to identify key features and patterns.
To build and train a machine learning model for credit risk prediction.
To evaluate the performance of the model and optimize it for better accuracy.
To deploy the model for real-time credit risk assessment.

Scope:

The project will focus on the following tasks:

Data Collection and Preparation
Data Exploration and Visualization
Feature Engineering
Model Training and Evaluation
Model Deployment

Deliverables:

Cleaned and preprocessed dataset.
Data exploration and visualization reports.
Trained machine learning model for credit risk prediction.
Model evaluation and performance metrics.
Deployed model for real-time predictions.

Project Plan:

Phase 1: Data Collection and Preparation

Task 1.1: Identify data sources and collect historical loan data.
Task 1.2: Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, convert data types, etc.).
Task 1.3: Save the cleaned dataset for further analysis.

Phase 2: Data Exploration and Visualization

Task 2.1: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and relationships.
Task 2.2: Visualize key features and their relationships with the target variable (credit risk).
Task 2.3: Document insights and identify potential features for modeling.

Phase 3: Feature Engineering

Task 3.1: Create new features or transform existing features to improve model performance.
Task 3.2: Select the most relevant features for the model.
Task 3.3: Prepare the final dataset for model training.

Phase 4: Model Training and Evaluation

Task 4.1: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Task 4.2: Train various machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, etc.).
Task 4.3: Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
Task 4.4: Optimize the best-performing model through hyperparameter tuning.

Phase 5: Model Deployment

Task 5.1: Develop a web service or API for real-time credit risk prediction.
Task 5.2: Deploy the model using a suitable platform (e.g., Flask, FastAPI, AWS, etc.).
Task 5.3: Test the deployed model and ensure it provides accurate predictions.
